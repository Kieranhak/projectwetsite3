  <h2>back pain</h2>
</div>

<div class="row">
 
    
    <div class="column side" style="background-color:#aaa;"><br>Upper and middle back pain is not as common as low back pain or neck pain,
       because the bones in this area of the back don't flex or move as much as the bones in your lower back or neck.</br>
        <br>Instead, they work with the ribs to keep the back stable and help protect vital organs, such as the heart and lungs.
    Upper and middle back pain may be caused by:</br>

<li>Overuse, muscle strain, or injury to the muscles, ligaments, and discs that support your spine.</li>
    <li>Poor posture.</li>
    <li>Pressure on the spinal nervesspinal nerves from certain problems, such as a herniated disc.</li>
    <li>A fracture of one of the vertebrae.</li>
<li>OsteoarthritisOsteoarthritis caused by the breakdown of cartilage that cushions the small facet joints in the spine.</li>
    <li> ofascial pain that affects the connective tissue of a muscle or group of muscles.</li>
<li>In rare cases, pain may be caused by other problems, such as gallbladder disease, cancer, or an infection.</li>

</div>
 
    
    
    <div class="column middle" style="background-color:#bbb;"><br>Pain that is dull or achy, contained to the low back
Stinging, burning pain that moves from the low back to the backs of the thighs, sometimes into the lower legs or feet can include numbness or tingling (sciatica)
        Muscle spasms and tightness in the low back, pelvis, and hips</br>
<br>Pain that worsens after prolonged sitting or standing
Difficulty standing up straight, walking, or going from standing to sitting<br/>
    <br>Call Your Doctor About Back Pain If:</br>
<br>You feel numbness, tingling, or weakness in your groin, arms or legs; this may signal damage to the spinal cord.</br>
<br>Seek immediate medical help.</br>
<br>The pain in your back extends downward along the back of the leg; you may be suffering from sciatica.</br>
<br>The pain increases when you cough or bend forward at the waist; this can be the sign of a herniated disc.</br>
<br>The pain is accompanied by fever, burning during urination, or frequent and/or urgent urination.</br>
<br>You begin to have problems controlling your bowels or bladder; seek immediate medical help.</br>
 
Other "red flags" that could point to a serious back pain problem include:
 
<li>A history of cancer</li>
<li>Unintentional weight loss</li>
<li>You have been on steroids or medication that weakens your immune system</li>
<li><li>A history of trauma</li>
<li>Pain that is getting worse and does not get better after you rest</li>
<li>Pain that has lasted more than a month</li>
